### Controls
WASD/arrow keys to move (you can move backwards too)

On spawn/respawn, you have 2 seconds of invulnerability shown by the ship flashing

### Powerups
UFOs spawn occasionally to shoot at the player (their aim varies a lot), on death they will leave a powerup
- Fire rate: decreases the cooldown between shots, stacks until death
- Speed: increases both linear and turning speed, stacks until death
- Shield: the next hit you receive does no damage, and you become invulnerable for 2 seconds. Does not stack
